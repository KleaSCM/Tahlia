    - [ ] Material creation (PBR, quick setup, auto-assign)
    - [ ] Texture loading and assignment
    - [ ] PBR material creation with multiple maps
- [ ] Import history module (ImportHistory)

- [ ] FFI/Python bridge (PythonBridge)
    - [ ] Expose C++ core to Python (ctypes/pybind11)
    - [ ] Blender context management (preserve selection, etc.)
- [ ] Auditing, validation, and test scripts (Tests/)
    - [ ] Universal asset audit
    - [ ] Unit/integration tests for all modules
- [ ] Utilities/helpers (FileUtils, etc.)
    - [ ] Path helpers, legacy compatibility
- [ ] Documentation (Docs/)
    - [ ] Architecture diagrams, module docs, usage examples
